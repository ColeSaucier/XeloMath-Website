                XeloMath is a mobile application to help kids learn math. It emphasizes simplicity and interactivity for concept learning, 
                and success is based on improvement. Namely, the levels are timed for completion so young learners can experience their 
                skill and improvement directly. Along with this, the app requires no reading, so even exceptionally young users can try it. 
                Children will learn through interacting with changeable components and learning-oriented trial and error. There is a 
                leaderboard and stars for all levels: one star upon completion, two stars for reliable problem-solving speed, and three 
                stars upon mastery.

            <p>
                One of the most impactful choices was the use of a visually present speed component. We thought it’s important that users 
                can see when they improve. Instead of a loading bar, we call it a “Pace Bar,” and it ticks down at the rate for an improved 
                high score. There’s an intuitive feeling when you’re improving.

            <h2>Why is this app needed?</h2>
            <p>
                In traddional education, children primarily learn math in class with a teacher and a textbook. This has so many 
                limitations. First, they must learn new content when the teacher has time to teach it. Second, the teacher cannot tailor 
                well to fast learners, and oftentimes they are left repeating redundant information with an averaged approach. Third, 
                teachers rely on textbooks with written answers that takes time to be checked. 
                Fourth, when other math software is used, it cannot be run on mobile devices along with the web. Further, most 
                softwares do not incorporate improvement-based metrics. XeloMath addresses these gaps with a mobile, interactive, and 
                improvement-focused design.
